<h1>Vladan Simić</h1>
<h3><em>MSc in Physics, University of Belgrade, Serbia</em></h3>
<hr/>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I've been in science since my childhood, where I attended many state competitions in 
  physics and mathematics. After my graduation in General Physics in 2017, I was employed as a 
  research trainee in Institute of Physics, Belgrade, Serbia, where I worked for 4 years. After that,
  I decided to change profession to programming and now I'm eager to gain new knowledge. I've had
    plenty of work in Monte-Carlo simulations in science, so I think it is a natural step forward.
